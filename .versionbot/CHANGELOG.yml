                The code moved from meta-balena-kirkstone was not really
                specific to

                kirkstone so let's move it here so that future branches for newer yocto

                releases which we'll base off kirkstone don't continue to add this

                unneeded  duplication.

                There are other meta-balena-* directories that still contain the

                duplication we moved from meta-balena-kirkstone but we're not really

                concerned with that because going forward those old directories will

                naturally get deprecated.

                If the target supervisor image is already cached but there is no

                container running with it, the update script would just exit without

                actually running the target supervisor.


                This commit checks whether there is a running container using the

                target image and restarts the supervisor if there is none.

                During installation, some firmwares may allow keys to be
                enrolled but

                fail to tip the system into user mode until the system is rebooted. We

                don't want to mislead users with only full-disk encryption into thinking

                their system also has secure boot enabled when it doesn't.


                Disable the hook to unlock encrypted partitions if the firmware fails to

                boot into user mode.

                This flag isn't needed on balenaOS as the splash screen
                remains even after plymouthd is stopped.

                Having the flag in place prevents user apps from writing to
                tty consoles after stopping plymouth via dbus.

        Upstream uses AUTOREV and this causes two problems:
         - we don't know which revision has been used by which
           balenaOS release
         - automated Jenkins builds sometimes break when upstream performs changes
           and we can't easily determine the window in which the changes
           have been performed

        We thus pin the SRC_REV to the revision used when the device has

        been integrated with balenaOS, as per the upstream relese tag xml
