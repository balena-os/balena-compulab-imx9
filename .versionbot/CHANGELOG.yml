        Upstream uses AUTOREV and this causes two problems:
         - we don't know which revision has been used by which
           balenaOS release
         - automated Jenkins builds sometimes break when upstream performs changes
           and we can't easily determine the window in which the changes
           have been performed

        We thus pin the SRC_REV to the revision used when the device has

        been integrated with balenaOS, as per the upstream relese tag xml
