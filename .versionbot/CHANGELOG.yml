                        These contracts used to be copied to the core service at
                        build

                        time if private device types cloned the repo before
                        running test suites.


                        However, since switching to pre-built images by default
                        we need to

                        manually mount private contracts to the core service.

                        but does not accept build-args from the command line

                        instead, we want to always inherit some build args
                        from the environment via docker compose substitution

                The action currently has dependencies on the leviathan base
                project so we need to keep them aligned for now.

                If a future revision of the action performs it's own fetch of
                leviathan, we would revert this change.

                At this moment we sign 3 artifacts:

                * grub.cfg_external - for flasher (secure boot or not)

                * grub.cfg_internal_luks - for secure boot + LUKS

                * grub.cfg_internal - for regular systems


                We don't verify any signatures on systems with secure boot
                disabled

                so there is no need to sign grub.cfg_internal, on the contrary,
                having

                it signed only makes the file loadable on secure boot systems,

                which is undesirable.

                This allows to have multiple device types that build the same

                for example if they have different feature layers.

                When signed images are used without opting in secure boot, we
                don't want

                the encrypted mount service to run and fail as there is no
                encrypted

                boot partition.


                This commit adds a condition to the encrypted boot mount service
                to only

                run if the encrypted boot partition exists, similarly to what is

                already done for EFI builds.

                We switch to the recipe from Kirkstone which is still at version
                2.10

                but has other patches applied to it.


                The wpa_supplicant version from Kirkstone is from Poky revision

                This fixes auth issues we have seen on a Jetson TX2.

                        This has been broken since splitting the core from the

                We encountered the variance in expected and measured swap in the

                safe and allowing of more device types, changed the allowed
                variation - still small enough to actually check the value is
                right, but should reduce false negatives

                2.108.6 doesn't exist for generic-amd64. The tests used to still
                work, because we werent acually passing the version to
                kernel-module-build correctly, meaning that it would default to
                the one in the kernel-module-build project. That was fixed in
                4484c59fc924100232cc10303a4636ed0082760a , and now we are
                passing the version correctly, we're looking for a nonexistant
                version. Changing version to match the default.

                Machine refers to the Yocto machine configuration, while slug
                refers to

                the balenaCloud device type.


                This allows to build the same machine but deploy to a different
                device type.

                for the iot-gate-imx8. The iot-gate-imx8plus needs
                one as well because it's now using the meta-balena-hab
                submodule.

                This fixes the following error:

                The signed image symlink is not generated before the flasher needs it so we avoid this dependency issue by
                defining a new image type for which the build system will automatically create the appropriate symlink.

                The altboot test often hangs for a long time during the altboot
                test, after the DUT has booted into the old OS after the altboot
                failure - the check to see if the rollback systemd services have
                stopped hangs. This is an attempt to fix that, as I think
                there's some strange interaction going on with the while loop
                over ssh

                when the static version of the dispatcher was being compiled.
                Version 2.6.1 removed

                this copy of jimtcl from the source package so we add it back
                ourselves because it's

                easier to have libjim.a compiled here rather than add a whole
                new Yocto recipe just for it.

                At this moment balena-image-flasher depends on
                do_image_sign_digest

                and do_rootfs of balena-image, but this is not enough, as the
                signature

                symlink is only created by a postprocess script.


                This patch replaces the two existing dependencies by
                do_image_complete,

                which should cover everything.

                        This fixes a regression where dependencies would only be started in
                        order and would start the dependent service if its dependency had been
                        started at some point in the past, regardless of the running condition.

                        This makes the behavior more consistent with docker compose where the
                        [dependency needs to be
                        running or healthy](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/69a83d1303a103d82b05d512baf273244b4dbd94/pkg/compose/convergence.go#L441) for the service to be started.

                        between locked and unlocked DUTs for device types that
                        support secureboot.

                reboot and rollback.

              hash: 1ae37ac158b93df836126030abec8c3d3f69d92b
              body: >
                At this moment resin-init-flasher just takes whatever image lies
                in /opt

                and dd's it to the target drive. This is fine for general use,
                but with

                secure boot enabled, we want to perform at least basic
                authentication

                of the image being written.


                This patch gets the image signed at build time and makes flasher
                verify

                the signature against a key built-in the kernel trust store. At
                this

                very moment it fails hard if the signature does not match, but
                this may

                change in the future. Technically we only want to know if we are
                about

                to flash a balena-provided image or not, we might want to
                support both

                but behave slightly differently in each scenario.

                      hash: 828bd22ba053aa08ca2bde8e72b3aa7ed82aae02
                      body: >
                        This config backend uses ConfigJsonConfigBackend to
                        update

                        os.power and os.fan subfields under the "os" key, in
                        order

                        to set power and fan configs. The expected format for
                        os.power

                        and os.fan settings is:

                        ```

                        {
                          os: {
                            power: {
                              mode: string
                            },
                            fan: {
                              profile: string
                            }
                          }
                        }

                        ```


                        There may be other keys in os which are not managed by
                        the Supervisor,

                        so PowerFanConfig backend doesn't read or write to them.
                        Extra keys in os.power

                        and os.fan are ignored when getting boot config and
                        removed when setting

                        boot config.


                        After this backend writes to config.json, host services
                        os-power-mode

                        and os-fan-profile pick up the changes, on reboot in the
                        former's case

                        and at runtime in the latter's case. The changes are
                        applied by the host

                        services, which the Supervisor does not manage aside
                        from streaming

                        their service logs to the dashboard.

                        which report status from applying power mode and fan
                        profile configs as read

                        from config.json. The Supervisor sets these configs in
                        config.json for these

                        host services to pick up and apply.

                        will very soon be needed for Jetson Orins.

                        don't have a custom bridge. However, the Supervisor
                        creates a

                        custom bridge for all containers unless another network
                        mode is

                        specified.

                        installed at <v14.1.0,

                        in which a Supervisor app with random UUID is kept in
                        the target db due to its appId

                        being the same, even after the BM instance has upgraded
                        to v14.1.0 which patches

                        the correct reserved Supervisor app UUIDs in. This
                        results in two Supervisors running

                        on devices under the BM instance which persists after BM
                        upgrade.

                        On NXP iMX devices the partitions are not encrypted with
                        LUKS but with

                        the lower level dm-crypt subsystem.


                        Adapt the partition mount script to use dmsetup which
                        works for both

                        LUKS and dm-crypt encrypted partitions.

                        Debian no longer publishes linux/arm/v5 images for
                        bullseye, breaking

                        support for raspberry pi zero.


                        This change might not solve the issue indefinitely

                        as we don't know how long debian will continue
                        publishing armv5 images.

                        This moves from throwing an error when an app is
                        rejected due to unmet

                        requirements (because of contracts) to storing the
                        target with a

                        `rejected` flag on the database.


                        The application manager filters rejected apps when
                        calculating steps to

                        prevent them from affecting the current state. The state
                        engine uses the

                        rejection info to generate the state report.

                By default barys assumes there is only one integration layers
                and looks

                for the custom sample templates in there. This might not be the
                case

                if there are feature layers like adding secure boot support, so
                this

                commit allows to specify which layer to look the sample
                templates from.

              body: >
                Secure boots builds used to end up with a mismatch between the
                kernel

                and modules signatures because of the use of cache - to avoid
                this we

                temporarily forced builds without cache.


                With the fix in meta-balena
                389054e84c0b1fd382d737c39fb2bb02c2b3e9b2,

                kernel modules are always set not to use cache and this problem
                should

                no longer happen.


                At least during the i.MX secure boot local builds with cache
                never hit

                the problem.


                Remove the setting not to use cache.

                For the first deployment of the S3 download mirror we will
                err on the side of cost savings, and use the mirror as a
                fallback not the primary source of downloads.

                Revert this if we want the benefits of using our own mirrors
                as the primary source, like download speed and no rate limits.

                This change makes the legacy NFS cache mount
                optional, and will not fail the build if unset
                or unreachable.

                Instead, if the NFS is available it will be used
                as a read-only mirror for shared downloads,
                but will not be updated with new files.

                This is needed for supervisor managed OS updates. For example,
                the supervisor

                can check this metadata against the equivalent field from
                /etc/os-release to

                determine if the device is already running the latest OS
                release.

                because we do not associate the label with any commit.

                This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
                comment generated for each workflow run.

                Some device types (generic-armd64) need to run the test

                suites twice for the same base image, once with secure boot

                vars enabled in Leviathan, and once without.


                Rather than run the suites in series, or require building the

                image twice, we can allow the test matrix to define separate
                runs

                for the two modes.

                For instance, the github.job context is not accessible, as it's
                specific to the running job and not the concurrency group.

                Secure boot enabled partitions need to split the boot partition
                into

                an encrypted and a non-encrypted one.


                Unless the device type natively separates the files that the
                bootROM

                needs to boot, like EFI does into /mnt/boot/EFI, a list of files
                to

                move to the non-encrypted partition needs to be provided on the

                BALENA_NONENCRYPTED_BOOT_PARTITION_FILES variable, and a
                function

                to implement the split needs to be provided.


                This commit introduces a split_bootpartition() function that
                performs

                this and can be used for those platforms that need to list the
                boot

                essential files in a BALENA_NONENCRYPTED_BOOT_PARTITION_FILES
                variable.


                This is typically called from the bootpart_split() function in
                the

                balena-init-flasher customization file.

              hash: d1deb3e4fc8744fe66e1b5a726c82b4a856f2fe4
              body: >
                On secure boot enabled devices the boot partition is split into
                an

                encrypted boot partition (/mnt/boot) and a non-encrypted boot
                partition

                (/mnt/<name>).


                On the built rootfs all files live in `/mnt/boot`, and the
                installation

                needs to create an encrypted /mnt/<name> and move some files
                from

                /mnt/boot there.


                UEFI platforms make this easy as the non-encrypted files are
                stored on a

                different /mnt/boot/EFI folder. However, other platforms need to
                list

                which files to move by name.


                This commit introduces a skip_nonencrypted_boot_files() helper
                function

                for these other platforms to use.


                It is typically called from a do_skip() function in the
                os-helpers-sb

                secure boot customization file.

                This service needs to be restarted every time the
                fan profile is modified in config.json, so that
                it can apply the change and restart the device
                specific fan control daemon. This is unlike the
                power model service, which only runs once, at startup.

              hash: 2ede3ce578907c2f2eb75598b0b599bb12913929
              body: |
                At this moment the abroot script assumes that the boot partition
                is already in place when it executes. This might not be true
                if the rootfs sits on a device that takes a while to initialize,
                such as a USB drive. The script fails hard if that is the case.

                This patch replicates a waiting loop from the rootfs script,
                which addresses the same issue for systems that do not use
                the balena bootloader.

                The TPM is capable of storing a limited number of auth session

                handles'.

                We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

                migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto
                builds.


                As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
                bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

              hash: 625a45b652c332ec5d048caeee7dc25638df8dfb

                The "All jobs" job is used for branch protection
                as it captures the overall success/fail of all
                the test matrices and build.

                However without a unique name we are unable
                to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

                This change adds a single instance matrix
                to the build job and as a result will append the machine
                name and deploy environment in the job name.

                when building + deploying or a private DT , the check to see if the DT is private fails. This is due to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-api.inc#L424 using this function: https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-lib.inc#L191 - which uses the jenkins deployTo variable to select the correct api url and token.

                Previously an empty test matrix would cause
                an error in the workflow.

                Added an if condition to check for a valid
                test_suite property where applicable.

                Since we have moved to workflows for tests instead of status

                        This fixes a regression on the supervisor state engine
                        computation

                        (added on v16.2.0) when

                        the target state removes a network at the same time that
                        a service

                        referencing that network is changed. Example going from


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: 3.18
                              networks: ['balena']

                        networks:
                           balena:
                        ```


                        to


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: latest
                        ```


                        Would never reach the target state as killing the
                        service in order to

                        remove the network is prioritized, but one of the
                        invariants in the target state calculation is

                        to not kill any services until all images have been
                        downloaded. These

                        two instructions were in contradiction leading to a
                        deadlock.


                        The fix involves only adding removal steps for services
                        depending on a

                        changing network or volume if the service container is
                        not being removed

                        already.

              hash: 0b6199dddbb52e963d7b6e5feb5771f2b61a0f35
              body: >
                At this moment the kexec initrd script is skipped when
                ROOTFS_DIR

                is not defined or if the new rootfs is mounted, but does not
                contain

                a kernel image in the expected place. This is undesirable as we

                assume this is the last script executed by the balena
                bootloader.


                This patch makes the kexec script always execute in the balena

                bootloader and makes it fail hard in unexpected states, which
                means

                the script is always an exit point for the balena bootloader,

                whether the actual kexec call succeeds or not.

                simpler to assume an empty test matrix unless provided.

                We were previously introducing a variable that was essentially

                replicating the contents of an input. This commit makes use of
                the input

                directly.


                Incidentally, the previous code also had a small bug/typo, in
                which we

                mixed a test for string length with a test for string equality.

                The include syntax allows full control over settings used

                in each test job, but the combinatorial is simpler to write

                for basic use cases.


                Rather than force one, we can allow both and default to the
                simple

                syntax.


                Marking as minor since the input syntax has changed, but isn't

                currently used in production anywhere.

                At this moment the kexec initrd script just takes the original

                command line, replaces root with UUID and removes bootloader
                args.


                We have found at least one use-case (on the Pi4 and firmware
                GPIOs),

                where a different initrd script needs to pass extra arguments

                to the kexec'd kernel. With this patch it will append the
                contents

                of the KEXEC_EXTRA_ARGS variable to the kernel command line.

                with it we have also removed the runtime check for whether the
                running

                system is actually booted in UEFI mode.


                This effectively means it is no longer possible to update the
                host OS

                on a device type able to boot in both UEFI and BIOS modes

                (intel-nuc and genericx86-64-ext) when booted in BIOS mode,

                as the signed-update hook is executed unconditionally and fails

                if the device is not running UEFI.


                This patch re-adds the runtime check to only execute the hook

                if the system is actually booted in UEFI mode.

                On parallel builds that share a state cache there are mismatches

                a signed kernel and modules. Avoid using the cache when building
                signed

                modules to avoid this mismatch.

                        This goes in the direction of grouping modules by
                        responsibility. The

                        api-binder module is the middleware between the device
                        and the backend,

                        thus the target state polling code makes more sense
                        there.

                We have detected one more way in which the uuid file used by
                containerd

                can get corrupted. This time, the file is not empty, but doesn't
                contain

                a valid UUID either.


                This commit thus extends the existing workaround to also handle
                this

                case.

                When a ESR release is deployed a tag with the base meta-balena
                version

                is created. This is used by the API to check for a valid OS
                version

                for updates.


                The current mechanism to find the base version only provides an
                ESR

                version for the first commit after the branch has been created.


                Using merge-base to find the common ancestor and `tag
                --points-at` to

                find the actual tag works for all commits after the branch is
                created.

                Git describe does not include commit tags by default, and only
                annotated tags are shown.


                This behaviour was fine until a recent CI issue changed the
                types of tags used to version the repositories.


                This commit allows supporting of both types while the CI issue
                is investigated.

                tcgtool will improperly read zero bytes from efivar files. This

                in an improper calculation of the PCR 7 digest, and an
                unbootable

                system.


                Read the file contents, skipping the first four bytes that are

                attributes, and pipe the data directly to tcgtool to work around
                this.

                When rollback-health runs, a failing healthcheck causes the

                hostapp-update hooks to be run from the inactive partition, to
                make the

                inactive system bootable again.


                The 0-signed-update hook, which updates the sealing policy for
                secure

                boot enabled systems, reads from the securityfs mounted at

                /sys/kernel/security in order to parse the TPM event log.


                If this filesystem isn't mounted, the hook will improperly
                detect that

                the TPM event log isn't available, and unneccessarily create a
                combined

                policy when a single PCR policy would suffice.


                Mount this filesystem in old_rootfs before chrooting to fix
                this.

                In commit 1c19ebb, we append digests from the TPM event log

                corresponding to events that are logged before EV_SEPARATOR. For

                instance, parsing the event log on a typical system for event
                types, the

                output looks like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This system requires no merging of event log digests.


                On systems that measure EFI binaries (mostly only QEMU w/ edk2),
                we also

                get this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bootx64.efi)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bzImage)


                Again, this requires no merging. We compute the signature of the

                relevant EFI binaries ourselves, as they're subject to change
                during

                hostapp-update.


                However, we've also seen event logs like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This case is the one we've handled previously, by reading from
                the event

                log and appending event digests before EV_SEPARATOR. We stopped
                at

                EV_SEPARATOR because we weren't parsing event types previously,
                and this

                digest is a constant that's easily recognized. However, we've
                since

                encountered systems that have unexpected events *after*
                EV_SEPARATOR, as

                shown below.


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                Unknown event type (?!)


                In order to handle this, parse digests and event types into
                temporary

                files and iterate through them together. We only stop appending
                digests

                from the event log when the next event type is
                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY

                (EFI binary signature) or we hit the end of the list. This
                should

                account for all possible variations.

                The source code for this driver hasn't been updated in 9 years
                so

                let's remove it by also considering we were not using it.
                Instead,

                machines that need to use a driver for this WiFi chipset can
                selectively

                enable the in-tree kernel driver which has been improved in the
                last years.

                condition.

                Both NetworkManager and balenaEngine add the rules to the top

                of the FORWARD chain instead of appending, so if we first look
                up

                a rule by number and then use the number to refer to it, we can
                not

                guarantee that the rule number has not changed (iow the rule has
                not

                been moved down) in the meantime.


                This patch removes the use of rule numbers completely and makes

                the "shared" dispatcher script refer to the rules by definition.

                This is a fix targeted for the revpi-connect-4 which requires a
                config.txt param to be present to connect to wifi. The old way
                we did this test results in the config.txt being wiped - so now
                we fetch and change the current state to maintain the existing
                configuration and avoid this

                        The `mdns-resolver` module does not provide a default
                        export. Trying to

                        use a default import notation, causes the `resolve`
                        function to not be

                        found, breaking MDNS resolution.

                        Since HTTP's server.close() is async, there is a slim
                        chance

                        for two instances of /v1/reboot or /v1/shutdown to be
                        processed.

                        If the server is already closed when server.close() is
                        called,

                        the call throws ERR_SERVER_NOT_RUNNING

                        which doesn't need to be surfaced to the user. This
                        change

                        only allows one server.close() attempt to occur at a
                        time.

                        The Supervisor should only care whether a lockfile
                        exists or

                        not. This also fixes an edge case where a user symlinked
                        a lockfile

                        to a nonexistent file, causing the Supervisor to enter
                        an error

                        loop as it was not able to `stat` the nonexistent file.

                        io-ts types that were generated using
                        `shortStringWithRegex` were testing

                        against `VAR_NAME_REGEX`, instead of the Regex that was
                        specified when

                        generating the type. This affected `DockerName` such
                        that service names with

                        a dash in the middle were returning as false when passed
                        through the

                        `DockerName.is` type guard, affecting how
                        `getServicesLockedByAppId` was

                        returning a map of locked services.

                The migrate module is currently only enabled if specified in
                config.json.

                This commit introduces a command line argument override for
                board

                integration layers to use. This allows for example for
                non-flasher device

                types to force the migration.

                As soon as the UUID is regenerated udev runs the correspondign
                rules.


                However, the rules expect the new UUID to be cached in a file,
                so there

                is a race condition between the creation of the file and the
                udev rule.


                This commit avoid the race condition by using a file mutex that
                the

                udev rule can wait on.

                As soon as the UUID is modified udev re-runs the rules for the
                partition.

                However, the rule expects the new root UUID to be cached in a
                file, and

                if the udev rule gets there before the file is created it fails.


                This commit waits on a lock file mutex before accessing said

                Remounting filesystems is done on systems with a broken clock in
                order

                to prevent tune2fs from bailing out when the last mounted time
                is in the

                future. This resets the last mounted time to now.


                However, the filesystem is immediately unmounted again without
                being

                utilized, and the mount and unmount process is time consuming.
                Instead,

                use `-e continue` to tell tune2fs to continue after an error,
                which

                achieves the same result with less time and complexity.

                This change is required to migrate existing tests to run QEMU
                worker tests on GitHub Actions.

                GitHub hosted runners can't run the `ping` command:
                https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/1519 by design.

                If we still intend to use `ping`, the solution would be running
                QEMU worker tests on self-hosted runners which allow ICMP
                packets

                The takeover project currently relies on the ldd script being
                present in the hostOS pre-migration.


                While takeover can be adapted to use this script from a
                different location, it wouldn't hurt to have ldd in the hostOS
                from this point on.

                        With Alpine 3.19, iptables gets bumped to 1.8.10 which
                        uses nftables.

                        The host OS still uses iptables 1.8.7 (legacy), and we
                        should

                        use legacy as well until the OS uses nftables.

                The main variables measured into PCR7 to ensure secure boot
                configuration integrity are the state and EFI vars, including PK, KEK,
                db, dbx, etc.

                However, some systems have firmware that will measure other, unexpected
                events, such as "DMA Protection Disabled" (related to a Windows feature
                [0]), or "Unknown event type" with strange data.

                These events can't be predicted, and other devices may have different
                measured events that aren't compliant with the TCG spec, so attempt to
                check the TPM event log and extend our digest with any unknown events
                that fit the bill.

                When migrating the TPM2 policy used to secure the LUKS
                passphrase to use

                different PCRs, we temporarily want to maintain fallback
                capability in

                case the newly installed hostapp doesn't pass healthchecks. This
                allows

                the system to boot back into the original OS and try again.


                In order to do so, we leave the passphrase in place with the old
                PCR

                authentication policy. The cryptsetup hook in the initramfs will
                try

                PCRs 0,2,3,7 and if those don't work we fallback to the original
                PCRs.


                Once the new system successfully boots, we'll re-encrypt the
                passphrase

                and use the new PCRs to create a policy to secure the key.

                When encrypting the LUKS passphrase, we need the ability to
                construct a

                policy that can logically OR together multiple policies, such as
                when

                the machine may or may not measure binaries loaded through EFI
                boot

                services into PCR7.


                We also need the ability to update the sealing policy to revoke

                previously valid configurations, such as after
                hostapp-healthcheck

                completes successfully. Ideally, this should be completed before

                modifying any efi variables, to prevent the system from becoming

                unbootable in the event of an interrupted update.


                These requirements necessitate the ability to create sealing
                policies

                and authenticate against them outside of the
                hw_{en,de}crypt_passphrase

                functions.


                This commit allows the caller to setup the sealing policy when

                encrypting, and choose what kind of authentication to use when

                decrypting.

              hash: 374c4c32df59cc00e0b04d0c619f6fb98a69f1a5
              body: >
                The dispatcher script that moves around FORWARD rules of shared

                interfaces currently calls iptables assuming it will always work

                but in practice two iptables commands can not run in parallel

                and we have occasionally seen the script fail with:


                Another app is currently holding the xtables lock.

                Perhaps you want to use the -w option?


                This patch adds the -w option to make the script wait for the
                lock

                when necessary.


                It also makes the script exit with an error code if anything
                fails,

                which will log the output as WARN instead of INFO as the errors

                are easy to overlook at this moment.

                We don't need any iptables features in order to perform

                hostapp-update in this build recipe, and it has no impact

                on build output.


                It does, however, improve compatbility with build environments
                and

                reduces the dependencies of the build host kernel.

                The supervisor will now write the following dtoverlay setting

                "gpio-key,gpio=4,active_low=0,gpio_pull=down"

                into config.txt in the following form:

                dtoverlay=gpio-key
                dtparam=gpio=4
                dtparam=active_low=0
                dtparam=gpio_pull=down

                So we need to rework the test to account for these changes.

                a203bcdfd567c0cc4b4ed9de493513142cd7463f introduced a dependency

                on /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults to hostapp-update-hooks,
                however

                during HUP the script is not only executed in the "new" OS
                container

                but directly in the context of the "old" OS as well, so

                /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults needs to exist there.

                The file was introduced in balenaOS v2.99.28, so trying to HUP

                from anything before that will fail.


                This patch changes this to a soft dependency so even if the file

                is missing HUP will continue.

              hash: e984b21b0270729784735d99f222294be65afd20

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe looks for the root
                partition

                by UUID and assumes that only a single device is returned. This

                assumption breaks when the root is on a MD RAID1 device as not
                only

                the virtual MD device holds a filesystem with the given UUID,

                each member does as well.


                This patch makes resin_update_state_probe ignore devices

                that are RAID members which in that case will only return

                the MD device as expected.

                Currently devices with on-board storage fail to build in jenkins, if they don't provide a flasher image. One example is the CM4. Since there are multiple devices using this configuration, let's re-enable builds for all of them.

                        RPI firmware configuration allows repeating overlays to
                        define

                        configurations on multiple devices. For instance, for
                        configuring

                        multiple `ads` devices, `config.txt` needs to be setup
                        this way


                        ```

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x48

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x49

                        ```


                        Before this change, the supervisor would interpret both
                        lines as

                        belonging to the same overlay, preventing users from
                        configuring multiple

                        devices, and leading to a loop when trying to apply
                        configurations with

                        repeated overlays coming from the cloud side.

                        Rsync (v2) deltas have been broken since [Supervisor v14](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/commit/460c3ba0aab31d18a02e3f5dda1838691768c494). While considered legacy,
                        they are still used by a few customers with devices running OS < 2.47.1.
                        This should fix v2 delta support for those devices until we can
                        completely remove rsync deltas from the supervisor

                      hash: e22253ce6ebc40e865b5bc26844901026f04ec4e
                      body: >
                        Previously, getBootConfig() of the config.txt backend
                        was omitting

                        array configurations such as gpio settings, thus
                        resulting in the SV

                        mistakenly assuming that boot config had not been
                        applied, since gpio

                        would not be in current config.txt config but would be
                        in target config.

                        This resulted in SV entering an infinite loop of
                        attempting to apply the

                        gpio config when it wasn't necessary.

                      hash: 6e6a796da5ecc846248eae4c8495bc626964c038

                        While ordering is important in the RPI firmware configuration file (config.txt),
                        some dt params are by default considered part of the base dt overlay
                        if they are not used by other overlays.
                        Unfortunately the [list of dtparams](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L133)
                        is too long to add all of them as exceptions, but we can add the params
                        used in the default config.txt provided in OS images, to avoid reboots
                        when updating to this new supervisor and correctly parsing the
                        provisioning config.txt as variables.

                        While this addition handles most common scenarios, there is still a
                        chance a user may have use other base overlay dt params in the initial
                        config, in which case those will be interpreted according to the
                        relative ordering

                        DT overlays and DT params need to be consumed in the
                        order that they

                        appear on the file. DT params apply to the last
                        dtoverlay defined on the

                        file, or to the base overlay.


                        This commit updates config.txt parsing to consider this
                        ordering, and it

                        also ensures global dtparams are written first so they
                        cannot be

                        overriden by later overlays.


                        Because of the more strict parsing method, it is
                        possible that existing

                        HOST_CONFIG vars do not match the interpretation of the
                        parser. If

                        that's the case, the supervisor will re-apply the target
                        state which

                        will cause the device to reboot.

                During HUP, rollback-health-breadcrumb and
                rollback-altboot-breadcrumb

                are created in the state partition to trigger rollback-health
                and

                rollback-altboot respectively on the next boot. After these
                services

                complete, they will remove these breadcrumbs.


                Make the broken init fallback tests wait for these services to
                become

                inactive before testing the state of the breadcrumbs. Otherwise,
                a race

                condition can make these tests fail. Most notably on slower
                systems,

                such as emulated generic-aarch64.

            - subject: "balena-image-bootloader-initramfs.bb: Add fsck module"
              hash: 4b1bc7244ab21a9952ea7569c0c0e1bc9a11e2e0
              body: >
                The balena bootloader initramfs contains the rootfs module and
                that

                will get the rootfs mounted but not checked first for errors.
                This is

                problematic because at first boot with network connectivity
                available,

                time will sync but the rootfs will still have the last mount
                time in

                1970. If at that point the rootfs gets corrupted then at next
                boot

                the rootfs' initramfs module from balena-bootloader will try to
                mount

                the rootfs without checking it first and then after that the
                filesystem

                check triggered by the fsck module from the actual kernel
                initramfs will

                fail like this:


                [init][INFO] Running filesystem checks on partition resin-rootA
                (/dev/disk/by-state/resin-rootA)

                resin-rootA contains a file system with errors, check forced.

                resin-rootA: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked
                list found.


                resin-rootA: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
                        (i.e., without -a or -p options)

                This commit will add the fsck module to balena bootloader's
                initramfs

                which will trigger filesystem checks before the rootfs module
                runs.

                This fixes rollback-health failures for boards like the Jetson
                Seeeed

                J4012, which updates efivars for capsule updates from container
                hooks

                and not from the current OS hooks.


                While the actual HUP works because of /sys being bindmounted by

                hostapp-update, rollbacks will fail to run the old OS hooks
                unless

                efivarfs is mounted.

                        Moby v25 adds the dynamically generated MAC address to
                        the Config field,

                        which breaks the state engine, preventing the state from
                        settling as the

                        current state never matches the target state (empty mac
                        address). This

                        seems to be a bug in Moby that we reported in
                        moby/moby#47228


                        The issue won't affect Balena devices until balenaEngine
                        is updated, and this

                        change fixes testing for now.

                        This would cause

                        the docker utils test to fail since the network/subnet

                to inherit it and perform additional device-specific
                configuration.

                The kexec initrd script currently removes the maxcpus=0 kernel
                arg

                which we use to put the system into non-SMP mode. This however
                does

                not work on all platforms and nr_cpus=1 seems to be a more
                robust

                solution, so with this patch nr_cpus will be removed as well.

                chain"
              hash: 089f4d639383a4981d4840f9e22cccc97270b339
              body: >
                At this moment there is a race condition between NetworkManager

                and the engine when a shared interface is configured. If the
                interface

                is configured first and the engine second, the containers are
                allowed

                to access DHCP hosts behind the shared interface. If the engine
                comes

                up first and the shared interface second, access will be denied.


                This patch adds a dispatcher script that always configures the
                firewall

                rules as if the engine came up last. This does not really
                address

                the underlying issue but it overcomes the race condition and
                makes

                the behavior deterministic, which is good enough at this point.

                the host discoverable for 20 minutes should be sufficient to
                prevent these cases.

                        This is meant to allow users to configure their device
                        to

                        resolve `.local` queries via dnsmasq by modifying
                        config.json, e.g. `dnsServers":

                        "/bob.local/172.17.0.33`.


                        This would fail before as MDNS lookups would always come
                        first

                      hash: 3ea8d4727a4f4b068b308d1f407b7cf0dae2733b

                        The `updateMetadata` step renames the container to match
                        the target

                        release when the service doesn't change between
                        releases. We have seen

                        this step fail because of an engine bug that seems to
                        relate to the

                        engine keeping stale references after container
                        restarts. The only way

                        around this issue is to remove the old container and
                        create it again.

                        This implements that workaround during the
                        updateMetadata step to deal

                        with that issue.

                There have been reports of an empty config vars cache file -
                probably

                because of a race condition when the reading of config.json
                happens just

                as the file is being replaced.


                Add some checks and retries to avoid this errors from happening.

                The log files are kept in the /run partition that also houses
                the udev database.

                By moving the /run partition to $ROOTFS_DIR/run in the migrate
                module, the udev database persists across reboots.

                The udevcleanup module was introduced to cleanup the database
                so it's regenerated on the final rootfs as the rules are
                different between initramfs and final rootfs. By moving /run
                before udevcleanup ran, the cleanup was not effective.

                This commit moves the relocation of the /run mount to the
                finish module, after udevcleanup is run, and groups it with
                the other relocations needed for the pivot switch.

                Looking at git history, the relocation of the /run partition
                was initially done in the rootfs module, so when the migrate
                module was introduced and needed to mount the rootfs, this
                relocation was just moved into the migration module itself,
                without considering later modules like finish.

                This provides an easy switch to enable tracing on HUP hooks that
                works

                both on old and new OS hooks as enabling it depends on a
                config.json

                setting.


                It is meant to debug field issues with HUP failure where all we
                see is:

                ```

                Before hooks (old os) ran successfully

                Failed to run the new hooks. Running current hooks..

                ```

                For example:

                Detecting whether the script is running in a PID namespace by
                checking

                `/proc/1/sched` does not work for newer kernels

                (see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17917).


                Properly detecting this is too cumbersome for a bash logging
                script,

                see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17902, however,
                falling

                back to the last check, that is, seeing if `/.dockerenv` exists
                is easy

                enough and works for our use case.


                This script will only be called from the hostOS, and the only
                case it is

                called from a container is during HUP and the container is
                always a hostOS

                image. So even though the interface chosen by moby, a file under
                /,

                is a bad interface in general, it works fine for the specific
                limitations

                of balenaOS.


                Also, check for `/run/.containerenv` which is the equivalent
                interface

                for podman for future proofing.

                        Whenever the Supervisor reports current state, it diffs
                        the current state

                        with its last reported current state. However, when the
                        Supervisor starts

                        up, there is no last reported state, since that last
                        report is stored in

                        process memory. Caching the last report in a location
                        that survives

                        Supervisor restarts will reduce the current report
                        bandwidth used on startup.

                We add a script which can be replaced by device repositories
                to implement device-specific healthchecks. One usecase for this
                test is the Jetson UEFI firmware update check,
                but can be extended to all other devices as needed.

                We previously tried to use a single time limit for the execution
                of the

                healthcheck test on all device types. This was causing
                occasional false

                positives in our Continuous Integration pipeline, though --
                especially

                on slow devices like Pi Zeros and the generic-aarch64, which
                runs on

                emulated hardware.


                This commit addresses this issue, this commit:


                1. Limits execution for device types for which we have collected
                enough
                   data to have a good idea of how long the test should take.
                2. Uses time limits specific for each device type.

                        PR #2217 removed the expose configuration but also
                        caused a regresion

                        where ports set via the `ports` configuration would no
                        longer get

                        exposed to the host, despite portmappings being set.
                        This fixes that

                        issue by exposing only those ports comming from port
                        mappings.

                        The docker EXPOSE directive and corresponding
                        docker-compose `expose`

                        service configuration serves as documentation/metadata
                        that a container

                        listens on a certain port that may be used for service
                        discovery but it doesn't

                        have any real impact on the ability for

                        other containers on the same network to access the
                        exposed service via

                        the port. In newer engine implementations, this property
                        may conflict

                        with other network configurations, and prevent the
                        container from being

                        started by the docker engine (see #2211).


                        This PR removes code that would manage the expose
                        property and takes the

                        property out of the whitelist. A composition with the
                        `expose` property

                        will result in the log message `Ignoring unsupported or
                        unknown compose fields: expose`.


                        While this change should not have operational impact, it
                        still removes

                        a previously supported configuration and as such there
                        is a chance of it

                        being a breaking change for some applications. For this
                        reason it is

                        being published as a new major version.

                The code moved from meta-balena-kirkstone was not really
                specific to

                kirkstone so let's move it here so that future branches for
                newer yocto

                releases which we'll base off kirkstone don't continue to add
                this

                unneeded  duplication.

                There are other meta-balena-* directories that still contain the

                duplication we moved from meta-balena-kirkstone but we're not
                really

                concerned with that because going forward those old directories
                will

                naturally get deprecated.

                If the target supervisor image is already cached but there is no

                container running with it, the update script would just exit
                without

                actually running the target supervisor.


                This commit checks whether there is a running container using
                the

                target image and restarts the supervisor if there is none.

                don't want to mislead users with only full-disk encryption into
                thinking

                their system also has secure boot enabled when it doesn't.


                Disable the hook to unlock encrypted partitions if the firmware
                fails to

                boot into user mode.

                This flag isn't needed on balenaOS as the splash screen
                remains even after plymouthd is stopped.

                Having the flag in place prevents user apps from writing to
                tty consoles after stopping plymouth via dbus.

        Upstream uses AUTOREV and this causes two problems:
         - we don't know which revision has been used by which
           balenaOS release
         - automated Jenkins builds sometimes break when upstream performs changes
           and we can't easily determine the window in which the changes
           have been performed

        We thus pin the SRC_REV to the revision used when the device has

        been integrated with balenaOS, as per the upstream relese tag xml
